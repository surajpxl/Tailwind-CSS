          <strong class="text-xl">Steve Jobs' journey is the epitome of entrepreneurial spirit.</strong>
          Starting Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, facing adversity after being pushed out in 1985, and then returning to steer the company away from bankruptcy in 1997, his story is one of resilience. By the time of his passing in October 2011, Apple had become the most valuable company globally. 
          Jobs didn't just create a company; he redefined seven industries: personal computing, animated films, music, mobile phones, tablets, retail, and digital publishing. His innovation places him alongside America's greatest inventors like Edison, Ford, and Disney. These innovators, while flawed, will be remembered for how they harnessed creativity in technology and business.

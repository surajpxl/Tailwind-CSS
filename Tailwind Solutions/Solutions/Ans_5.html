          <strong class="text-xl">Steve Jobs' legacy as an entrepreneurial innovator</strong>
          is monumental. He co-founded Apple in 1976 in his parents' garage, faced significant challenges, including being ousted in 1985. He returned to Apple in 1997, rescuing it from near collapse and transforming it into one of the world's most valuable companies by the time of his death in October 2011. Jobs’ influence spanned multiple industries including personal computing, animated films, music, smartphones, tablets, retail, and digital publishing. He is remembered alongside other great American innovators like Edison, Ford, and Disney, not for personal flaws but for his transformative contributions to technology and business.

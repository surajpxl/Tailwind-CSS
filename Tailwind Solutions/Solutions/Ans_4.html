          <strong class="text-xl">Steve Jobs' entrepreneurial saga is a powerful narrative:</strong>
          Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 in his parents' garage, faced setbacks including being ousted in 1985, but returned to steer the company from near failure in 1997. By the time of his death in October 2011, Apple was the most valuable company globally. Jobs' influence extended across seven industries: personal computing, animated films, music, mobile phones, tablet computing, retail, and digital publishing. He joins the ranks of America's greatest innovators such as Edison, Ford, and Disney. Their legacy endures, not for their personal flaws but for their visionary approach to technology and business.

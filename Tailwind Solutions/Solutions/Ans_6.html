          <strong class="text-2xl">Steve Jobs' entrepreneurial journey</strong>
          began in his parents' garage in 1976, co-founding Apple, only to be ousted in 1985. He made a remarkable comeback in 1997, steering Apple from near bankruptcy to becoming the world’s most valuable company by his death in 2011. His influence extended across multiple industries, including personal computing, animated films, music, telecommunications, tablet computing, retail, and digital publishing. Jobs is remembered among America’s great innovators such as Edison, Ford, and Disney, for his imaginative approach to technology and business.

          Reflecting on his leadership, Jobs once mentioned, “Look at the results.” He surrounded himself with brilliant minds who could have easily moved on if mistreated, but chose to stay and achieve extraordinary results. The success of Apple's revolutionary products like the iMac, iPod, iTunes, Apple Stores, and the iPhone, alongside every Pixar film, underscores his lasting impact. Despite his final battle with illness, Jobs was supported by a loyal team, a loving family, and his visionary leadership.

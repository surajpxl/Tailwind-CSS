          <strong class="text-xl">Steve Jobs' remarkable journey</strong>
          began in his parents' garage with Apple in 1976. After being dismissed in 1985, he returned in 1997 to revive the company from near collapse. By the time of his death in October 2011, Apple had become one of the world’s leading tech giants. His innovations spanned personal computing, entertainment, telecommunications, and more, placing him among America's greatest innovators like Edison, Ford, and Disney. Despite his flaws, his visionary approach to technology and business will be remembered.

          In one of the final conversations I had with Steve, he remarked on his demanding nature: “Look at the results,” he said. “These are all smart people I work with, and any of them could get a top job elsewhere if they were truly unhappy. But they don’t leave.” Reflecting on Apple's immense successes, including groundbreaking products like the iMac, iPod, and iPhone, it’s clear that his leadership fostered incredible achievements. Surrounded by devoted colleagues and family, Jobs' legacy endures.
